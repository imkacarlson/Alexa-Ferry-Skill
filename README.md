# Alexa-Ferry-Skill

This is the soure code repository for my 2019 Computer Science Senior Thesis project at Willamette University. For my project I solicited and organized past Washington State Ferry departure data and other sources of information. The information was fed through an Amazon Alexa skill that provides future departure predictions and other helpful information for ferry riders.
